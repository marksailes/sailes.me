At AWS I work as a specialist solutions architect for serverless. I work with a dizzying mix of customers at all levels 
of cloud experience. I also work with a lot of other AWS SAs to help them understand the differences between different 
services and in my case especially serverless ones.

A topic of conversation which often comes up with customers and other SAs is how to choose which messaging service is 
the best fit for a given problem. A couple of years ago this topic would have been a simpler flow diagram. Before the 
release of Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), Amazon MQ for Apache ActiveMQ and Amazon EventBridge
there wasn't so much cross over between the messaging services. Now the ven diagram is slightly more complex.
