My daughter is two and a half right now and when I look back at all the purchases we made, I think we did pretty well.
There would some duds in the mix but in this post I'd like to talk about my favourites of the last two and a half years.

## Newborn

[Chicco Next2Me Crib](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chicco-Next2me-Side-Sleeping-Crib/dp/B07DNTQKSL/) - You'll be getting up a lot in the night, with this you don't have to go far.

[Cheeky Wipes](https://www.cheekywipes.com/toilet-paper-alternative-family-cloth/family-cloth-toilet-roll-alternative-wipes.html) - Life will be a mess, these are basically reusable kitchen roll.

[Tommee Tippee Nappy Bin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tommee-Tippee-Simplee-Sangenic-Disposal/dp/B00X590PSA/) - A present from my best friend, *essential* if you're using disposable nappies.

## 6+ Months

[Silver Cross Cot Mattress](https://www.johnlewis.com/silver-cross-premium-true-fit-tm-cotbed-mattress-140cm-x-70cm/p5089641) - We had a really hard time finding a mattress which actually fitted a cot bed properly. This one was great.

[Grimm's Rainbow](https://www.babipur.co.uk/grimms-rainbow-twelve.html) - So much fun for kids and parents

[Cloth Nappies](https://www.babaandboo.com/) - Not for the faint hearted, but easier once you get the hang of the extra washing
